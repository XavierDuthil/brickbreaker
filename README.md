# brickbreaker
One of my first personnal projects: a Brick Breaker without bricks. The idea was to implement collisions in a 2D environment.

The goal is to keep the ball within the canvas as long as possible.

The current "engine" has limitations concerning the collision calculation with the paddle when the speed gets too high (it passes through).
